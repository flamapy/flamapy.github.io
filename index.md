### <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> Easily Extensible


* **Plugin Generator**: Simplifies the process of creating new plugins with a semi-automatic generator, making customization and expansion straightforward.
* **Variability in Models**: Initially supports cardinality-based feature models, with the flexibility to easily incorporate other types like attributed feature models.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-life-ring"></i> Robust Solver Support

* **PySAT Integration**: Utilizes the PySAT metasolver, offering access to more than ten distinct solvers. This diversity allows for optimal solution finding across various complex scenarios.

### <i class="fa-brands fa-searchengin"></i> Comprehensive Operations

* **Multi-Model Operations**: Designed with capabilities for handling complex multi-model operations similar to those in Familiar.
* **Single-Model Focus**: Also supports operations targeted at single-model scenarios, providing versatility in usage.
