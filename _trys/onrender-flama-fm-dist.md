## Execute and use Flama as a REST API
[Go to On Render](https://flamapy.onrender.com/)

Currently, we do offer a distribution for Flama wich is intended for feature model practitioners. It will install all the dependencies and requirements to perform automated analysis over feature models. You can take a look on (https://github.com/flamapy/flamapy-fm-dist) to deploy it by yourself. 

Nonetheless, you can directly use a version hosted on the free service onrender. However, note that this is a free-tier service and probably could not cope with large feature models.
